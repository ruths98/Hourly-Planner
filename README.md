# Hourly Planner Site

## This webpage serves to provide a place to plan a typical workday, and will retain all tasks entered each time slot.

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQUERY, I have created a functional daily work planner that will tell the time, determine which time block matches said time, and will save any text entered into the time slot boxes.

## Installation
